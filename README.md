# GitHub self-hosted runner matrix build visualizations for Kubernetes and Raspberry Pi

[![awesome-runners](https://img.shields.io/badge/listed%20on-awesome--runners-blue.svg)](https://github.com/jonico/awesome-runners)

This repository contains various GitHub Action workflows to trigger Matrix builds on self-hosted GitHub Action runners and visualize their outputs and pod allocations on LED matrices connected to Raspberry PI. Similar visualization scripts are also available for desktop PCs.
